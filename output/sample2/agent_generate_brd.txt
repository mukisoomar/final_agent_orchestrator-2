# Business Requirements Document

## Introduction
The system being analyzed is an Inventory Management System. The system is designed to manage an inventory with various operations such as add, delete, update, query, and report.

## Business Problem/Opportunity
The original program likely addressed the business problem of managing a large inventory of items. This includes tracking item details, quantities, supplier information, and customer records. The system also handles errors and logs transactions, indicating a need for reliable record-keeping and auditing capabilities.

## Proposed Solution Overview (Modernization Context)
A modernized version of this functionality might be a cloud-based inventory management service. This service could be implemented as a microservice architecture, allowing for scalability and flexibility. It could provide a user-friendly interface for managing inventory and customer data, and integrate with other systems for logging transactions and fetching customer data.

## Key Functional Requirements
- The system must manage an inventory of up to 1000 items.
- The system must manage records for up to 500 customers.
- The system must provide operations to add, delete, update, and query items in the inventory.
- The system must generate reports on the inventory.
- The system must log each transaction, excluding system exit operations.
- The system must handle errors, including file not found, invalid input, and system errors.
- The system must fetch customer data from an external module.
- The system must maintain customer attributes, including active status, credit status, and tax exemption status.

## Non-Functional Requirements (Optional/Inferred)
- The system should perform operations efficiently to handle large volumes of data (up to 1000 items and 500 customers).
- The system should ensure data integrity, as it manages important inventory and customer data.
- The system should be reliable, as it is expected to handle errors and continue operation.
- The system should ensure secure access to customer data, as it fetches customer data from an external module.
- The system should maintain a log of transactions for auditing purposes.
